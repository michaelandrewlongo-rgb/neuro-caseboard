# Procedure-First CasePrep V1 Implementation Plan

> **For Hermes:** Use subagent-driven-development skill to implement this plan task-by-task.

**Goal:** Convert CasePrep from topic-centered literature/template generation into a procedure-first, case-centric operative preparation tool for night-before / morning-of-surgery neurosurgical prep.

**Architecture:** A free-text case string is progressively structured into a canonical `CaseSpec`. The core builder uses that structured case plus a small procedure-family taxonomy to drive retrieval, synthesis, rendering, provenance, and evaluation. `caseprep.yaml` is the source of truth; markdown dossier files are the primary user-facing artifact; the dashboard remains secondary.

**Tech Stack:** Python 3.10+, argparse CLI, existing CasePrep core builder/retriever abstractions, pytest, markdown/YAML rendering, optional OpenRouter LLM synthesis through existing `caseprep.llm` path.

---

## 1. Product Target

CasePrep V1 should optimize for a neurosurgery resident or attending preparing for a booked case. The output should be readable in roughly 10-15 minutes and answer:

- What anatomy matters for this procedure?
- What are the approach-specific steps and danger zones?
- What decisions could change the plan?
- What complications should be anticipated and how should they be rescued?
- What evidence or outcomes data meaningfully affects management?
- What critical case facts are missing?

This is not a generic disease summary or literature review. Literature, citations, evidence tables, and future video/visual resources support the operative briefing; they are not the product itself.

## 2. Explicit Non-Goals / Deferred Work

Deferred until after V1 text-dossier quality is proven:

- Surgical video retrieval and ranking.
- Anatomy atlas / visual figure retrieval and ranking.
- Multimodal image/video summarization.
- Citation auto-repair for LLM source-number misattribution.
- YAML-backed procedure taxonomy.
- Full semantic/RAG retrieval redesign.
- PHI handling beyond warnings and local-only storage.
- ML source ranker.

Citation repair is a saved future idea: if a claim cites the wrong `[S#]` but is supported by another source, repair safely only when overlap is strong; numeric claims require the exact number in the replacement source; repairs should be recorded in provenance.

## 3. V1 Canonical Evaluation Cases

Primary quality eval cases:

1. Spine / approach nuance
   - Input: `C5-6 anterior cervical discectomy and fusion for right C6 radiculopathy from foraminal disc osteophyte complex`
   - Must cover: anterior cervical exposure, localization, discectomy/decompression steps, foraminal/uncinate nuance, graft/cage/plate choices, recurrent laryngeal nerve, esophagus, vertebral artery, dysphagia, and when posterior cervical foraminotomy would be preferred.

2. Supratentorial tumor
   - Input: `right frontal convexity meningioma resection near the superior sagittal sinus`
   - Must cover: edema, sinus invasion vs abutment, arterial supply, cortical/bridging veins, craniotomy planning, dural opening, circumferential devascularization, debulking vs extracapsular dissection, brain/venous preservation, dural management/Simpson grade, venous infarct, seizures, hemorrhage, edema, neurologic deficit, and selected alternatives such as observation/SRS.

3. Chiari decompression
   - Input: `suboccipital craniectomy and C1 laminectomy for Chiari I malformation with syringomyelia`
   - Must cover: foramen magnum anatomy, tonsils, obex, PICA, brainstem, upper cervical cord, decompression extent, C1 laminectomy, bone-only vs duraplasty, arachnoid opening risks/benefits, selective tonsillar reduction, syrinx as a modifier, CSF leak, pseudomeningocele, aseptic meningitis, and craniocervical instability.

4. Endovascular stroke
   - Input: `mechanical thrombectomy for acute ischemic stroke due to right M1 middle cerebral artery occlusion`
   - Must cover: M1/M2 anatomy, lenticulostriate/perforator risk, femoral/radial access acknowledgement, guide catheter / balloon guide / distal access catheter concepts, aspiration vs stent retriever vs combined technique, first-pass effect, TICI/mTICI, time window / imaging selection, vessel perforation, dissection, distal emboli, symptomatic ICH, vasospasm, access complications, IV thrombolysis if eligible, medical management when not eligible, and rescue angioplasty/stenting only in appropriate context.

Parser/degraded-mode tests:

- `vestibular schwannoma`
- `MCA aneurysm`
- `cervical radiculopathy`
- `Chiari`
- `stroke thrombectomy`

Degraded-mode tests pass if they identify what they can, avoid pretending a procedure/approach is known, list missing critical facts, and label the output as generic/degraded.

## 4. V1 Quality Rubric

Score generated full-case outputs on a 100-point scale:

- 25 pts: Procedure-specific technique — steps, sequence, decisions, technical nuance.
- 20 pts: Anatomy at risk — named structures, approach-relevant relationships, danger zones.
- 15 pts: Complications and rescue — likely/catastrophic complications, prevention, intraop/postop response.
- 10 pts: Alternatives / decision boundaries — why this approach, when plan changes.
- 10 pts: Evidence and outcomes — relevant rates/landmark evidence, cited and not fabricated.
- 10 pts: Case-specificity / missing facts — uses parsed modifiers, flags missing plan-changing details.
- 5 pts: Readability — concise operative prep, not citation dump.
- 5 pts: Source attribution / provenance — citations trace to source, uncertainty labeled.

Pass threshold:

- Overall score >= 75.
- No zero in technique, anatomy, or complications.
- No fabricated numerical claims.
- No blank or generic major section.

Raw extracted snippets may be written as a degraded fallback, but do not count as passing V1 quality. Narrative synthesis is required for a passing V1 dossier.

## 5. Canonical Internal Model

The canonical object is a case, not a topic. The CLI may still accept one free-text string, but internally the builder should operate on a structured case object.

Proposed interfaces:

```python
@dataclass(frozen=True)
class CaseField:
    value: str | None
    confidence: float
    source: str  # extracted | synonym | inferred | llm | missing
    span: str | None = None
    notes: str | None = None

@dataclass(frozen=True)
class CaseSpec:
    raw_input: str
    pathology: CaseField
    procedure: CaseField
    approach: CaseField
    procedure_family: CaseField
    broad_profile: CaseField
    laterality: CaseField
    level_or_segment: CaseField
    size: CaseField
    anatomic_location: CaseField
    patient_modifiers: tuple[CaseField, ...]
    imaging_modifiers: tuple[CaseField, ...]
    missing_critical_facts: tuple[str, ...]
    degraded: bool
    degradation_reason: str | None = None
```

Important rules:

- Preserve `raw_input` in local `caseprep.yaml` for auditability and reproducibility.
- Warn users not to include PHI.
- Do not silently guess uncertain fields.
- Medium-confidence inferred fields may be used for retrieval if marked uncertain.
- Low-confidence/missing procedure or approach should produce a visibly degraded generic build.

## 6. Procedure-Family Taxonomy

Add a small Python taxonomy first. Do not move to YAML until concepts stabilize.

Proposed file:

- Create: `caseprep/procedure_taxonomy.py`

Proposed interface:

```python
@dataclass(frozen=True)
class ProcedureFamily:
    id: str
    display_name: str
    broad_profile: str
    procedure_aliases: tuple[str, ...]
    pathology_aliases: tuple[str, ...]
    approach_aliases: tuple[str, ...]
    required_fields: tuple[str, ...]
    missing_fact_prompts: tuple[str, ...]
    retrieval_templates: dict[str, str]
    section_headings: dict[str, tuple[str, ...]]
    eval_required_concepts: tuple[str, ...]
```

Initial V1 families:

- `spine_acdf` -> broad profile `spine`
- `tumor_convexity_meningioma` -> broad profile `supratentorial_tumor`
- `posterior_fossa_chiari` -> broad profile `posterior_fossa` or `congenital`
- `endovascular_thrombectomy` -> broad profile `vascular`

Each family should contain aliases, required fields, missing-fact prompts, retrieval templates, section headings, and eval-required concepts.

## 7. Hybrid Parser Strategy

Add deterministic parsing first; add LLM enrichment as optional/fallback later in the same seam.

Proposed file:

- Create: `caseprep/case_parser.py`

Proposed functions:

```python
def parse_case_input(raw_input: str, *, use_llm: bool = False) -> CaseSpec:
    """Parse free-text procedure/case input into CaseSpec."""


def deterministic_parse_case(raw_input: str) -> CaseSpec:
    """Extract high-confidence fields via aliases, regex, and taxonomy."""


def select_procedure_family(case: CaseSpec) -> ProcedureFamily | None:
    """Select the best procedure family from parsed procedure/pathology/approach."""
```

Deterministic parser should extract:

- Procedures/approaches: ACDF, anterior cervical, posterior foraminotomy, craniotomy/resection, suboccipital decompression, C1 laminectomy, mechanical thrombectomy.
- Pathologies: cervical radiculopathy, disc osteophyte complex, convexity meningioma, Chiari I, syringomyelia, acute ischemic stroke, M1 occlusion.
- Laterality: right, left, bilateral.
- Levels/segments: C5-6, C6, M1, frontal convexity.
- Modifiers: near superior sagittal sinus, syringomyelia, serviceable hearing, ruptured/unruptured, foraminal, etc.

LLM parser/enricher, when added, must return confidence/provenance and must not overwrite high-confidence deterministic fields unless explicitly better and traceable.

## 8. Build Request / Core Builder Integration

Modify the core path for new procedure-first work.

Relevant files:

- Modify: `caseprep/core/contracts.py`
- Modify: `caseprep/core/builder.py`
- Modify: `caseprep/schema.py`
- Modify: `caseprep/renderers/markdown.py` if needed
- Modify: `caseprep/adapters/caseplan.py` if MCP/web adapter conversion is needed

`BuildCasePlanRequest` should keep a topic fallback but gain a case-input seam:

```python
@dataclass(frozen=True)
class BuildCasePlanRequest:
    topic: str | None = None
    case_input: str | None = None
    output_dir: Path | None = None
    max_per_category: int = 3
    profile_hint: str | None = None
    # existing fields preserved
```

Builder behavior:

1. Resolve raw case input:
   - `case_input` if present.
   - else `topic` as a fallback.
2. Parse into `CaseSpec`.
3. Select procedure family.
4. Derive broad profile from procedure family, not from topic-only profile classifier when possible.
5. Generate retrieval axes from `CaseSpec` + `ProcedureFamily`.
6. Retrieve evidence.
7. Apply simple surgical-usefulness source ranking.
8. Synthesize sections.
9. Render `caseprep.yaml`, markdown dossier, and provenance.
10. Persist if configured.

## 9. Procedure-Aware Retrieval

Minimum V1 retrieval changes should use `CaseSpec`; do not rebuild the retriever stack.

Proposed function:

```python
@dataclass(frozen=True)
class RetrievalAxis:
    id: str
    label: str
    query: str
    filter_type: str | None = None


def build_case_queries(case: CaseSpec, family: ProcedureFamily | None) -> list[RetrievalAxis]:
    """Build PubMed/corpus query axes from structured case fields."""
```

Axes should include:

- Anatomy / relevant structures.
- Outcomes / evidence.
- Surgical technique.
- Complications.
- Reviews / landmarks.

Use procedure-family templates such as:

- anatomy: `{approach} {pathology} anatomy {anatomic_location}`
- technique: `{procedure} {approach} technique operative steps`
- complications: `{procedure} {pathology} complications`
- outcomes: `{pathology} {procedure} outcomes`
- reviews: `{pathology} {procedure} systematic review`

Evidence records should carry metadata:

- axis
- query
- procedure_family
- broad_profile
- surgical_usefulness_score
- score_reasons

## 10. Surgical-Usefulness Ranking

Start with simple inspectable heuristics. Do not add an ML ranker in V1.

Proposed file:

- Create or modify: `caseprep/scoring.py`

Proposed function:

```python
def surgical_usefulness_score(
    record: EvidenceRecord,
    case: CaseSpec,
    family: ProcedureFamily | None,
    axis: str,
) -> tuple[int, list[str]]:
    """Return transparent source-usefulness score and reasons."""
```

Suggested features:

- +30 exact procedure/approach phrase in title.
- +20 pathology phrase in title.
- +15 technique terms in title/abstract.
- +15 complication/outcome terms when matching that axis.
- +10 anatomy/location terms.
- +10 technical note / operative series / review depending on axis.
- -20 off-domain drug-only/basic-science content.
- -20 irrelevant non-neurosurgical context.

## 11. CLI Build Command

Add an explicit build command. Do not overload `generate`.

Relevant file:

- Modify: `caseprep/cli.py`

Desired command:

```bash
caseprep build "C5-6 anterior cervical discectomy and fusion for right C6 radiculopathy from foraminal disc osteophyte complex" -o ~/cases/acdf
```

Behavior:

- Parses free-text case string into `CaseSpec`.
- Runs core builder.
- Writes populated dossier folder.
- Writes `caseprep.yaml` and `provenance.json`.
- Prints:
  - output path
  - pathology/procedure/approach/profile/family
  - missing critical facts
  - source counts
  - warnings/degradation status
  - quality/eval status if available

Compatibility:

- `caseprep generate <topic>` remains blank scaffold.
- Bare `caseprep <topic>` may remain `generate` for now to avoid breaking existing behavior.
- MCP/web should later call the same core builder path.

## 12. Rendering Requirements

`caseprep.yaml` should include the structured case object.

Markdown should include a clear case summary section containing:

- Raw case input.
- Parsed pathology.
- Parsed procedure.
- Parsed approach.
- Procedure family.
- Broad profile.
- Parsed modifiers.
- Missing critical facts.
- Degradation status, if any.

If procedure/approach is missing or low-confidence:

- Label as generic/degraded.
- Do not imply the system knows the booked approach.
- Retrieval should avoid over-specific approach terms.

## 13. LLM Synthesis and Degradation Policy

V1 passing output requires narrative synthesis.

If LLM synthesis succeeds and guardrails pass:

- Write coherent procedure-specific prose explaining HOW/WHY.
- Ground claims with citations.
- Avoid citation-dump factoids.

If LLM unavailable, too slow, or guardrails reject:

- Build should still complete.
- Write parsed case summary, evidence table, extracted source snippets, missing critical facts, and quality/degradation report.
- Label clearly:
  - `Synthesis unavailable` or `Synthesis rejected by guardrail`.
  - `This is not a finished operative briefing`.
- CLI prints warning.
- Eval harness treats this as V1 quality fail even though runtime degradation is acceptable.

Citation repair is not implemented in V1. Citation failures remain visible diagnostics.

## 14. Evaluation Harness

Make evaluation first-class in the repo.

Proposed files:

- Create: `caseprep/evaluation/__init__.py`
- Create: `caseprep/evaluation/canonical_cases.py`
- Create: `caseprep/evaluation/rubric.py`
- Create: `caseprep/evaluation/fixtures/`
- Create: `tests/test_case_parser.py`
- Create: `tests/test_procedure_taxonomy.py`
- Create: `tests/test_canonical_eval.py`

Proposed interfaces:

```python
@dataclass(frozen=True)
class CanonicalCase:
    id: str
    input_text: str
    expected_family: str | None
    required_concepts: tuple[str, ...]
    degraded: bool = False

@dataclass(frozen=True)
class EvalReport:
    case_id: str
    passed: bool
    score: int | None
    missing_required_concepts: tuple[str, ...]
    deterministic_failures: tuple[str, ...]
    degradation_status: str | None
    output_dir: str | None


def evaluate_case_output(output_dir: Path, canonical_case: CanonicalCase) -> EvalReport:
    """Run deterministic output checks for a generated dossier."""
```

Minimum deterministic checks:

- No blank placeholder text in major rendered sections.
- Parsed family matches expected family for full canonical cases.
- Degraded parser cases are labeled degraded.
- Required concepts appear in the relevant output files.
- Evidence table is non-empty for full canonical cases.
- Missing critical facts section exists.
- No fabricated numbers according to existing numeric guardrail where applicable.

For major pipeline changes, run blind neurosurgeon-style subagent review with no prior context. Optionally run ML-engineer review for retrieval/token/eval design.

5. Run `python3 -m pytest tests/test_canonical_eval.py tests/test_core_builder.py -v`.

## 16. Verification Commands

During implementation, run targeted tests after each task. Before declaring V1 slice complete, run:

```bash
cd /home/michael/projects/caseprep
python3 -m pytest tests/test_case_parser.py tests/test_procedure_taxonomy.py tests/test_core_builder.py tests/test_cli.py tests/test_canonical_eval.py -v
python3 -m pytest -v
```

For real output quality after implementation, run live builds for the four canonical cases and inspect the generated markdown, not just test results.

## 17. Acceptance Criteria

V1 implementation is accepted when:

- `caseprep build "..."` exists and invokes the core builder.
- The four canonical full-case strings parse into the expected procedure families.
- Degraded topic-only strings are labeled degraded and list missing critical facts.
- `caseprep.yaml` includes structured case data and provenance.
- Markdown dossier includes parsed case summary, missing facts, evidence table, and procedure-specific sections.
- Retrieval queries are generated from `CaseSpec` + procedure family, not raw topic alone.
- Evidence records include transparent surgical-usefulness scores/reasons.
- Fixture-backed canonical eval runs deterministically.
- LLM unavailable/guardrail failure completes as degraded output, not a crash.
- Passing V1 quality requires narrative synthesized output, not raw snippets.

## 18. Implementation Guidance

Keep implementation small and sequential:

1. Taxonomy.
2. Parser.
3. Core request seam.
4. Builder integration.
5. Retrieval planning.
6. Source scoring.
7. Rendering.
8. CLI build.
9. Eval harness.
10. Fixture-backed end-to-end checks.

Do not mix in deferred video/visual retrieval, citation repair, YAML taxonomy, or RAG redesign while implementing this plan.
