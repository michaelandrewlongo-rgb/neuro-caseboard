# caseprep

Generate structured neurosurgical case prep materials from a topic string.

## Install

```bash
pip install -e ".[dev]"
```

## Usage

```bash
caseprep "vestibular schwannoma"
caseprep "acoustic neuroma" --open
caseprep "pituitary adenoma" -o ~/cases/pa --local-pdfs ~/papers/
```

## Output

The canonical source of truth is `caseprep.yaml`. Markdown files are rendered
from that schema for quick review. `provenance.json` records whether content is
generated, inferred, cited, user-entered, or verified. Generated clinical
content should be treated as draft material until reviewed by a clinician.

## MCP Tools

```
search_pubmed       — PubMed search with clinical filters, optional abstracts
build_caseplan      — 4-axis search → filled templates + PMC full text
generate_caseprep   — blank (fill-in-the-blanks) template scaffold
get_fulltext        — 3-tier: PMC → structured → plain abstract for a PMID
search_local_pdfs   — PyMuPDF search of local PDF files
search_radiology    — Open-i (NIH) radiology images: MRI, CT, X-ray, ultrasound
```

## Run tests

```bash
pytest -v
```

## Planned Improvements

CasePrep was initially developed for neurointerventional (thrombectomy) cases, which have the most mature pipeline: procedure-specific evidence packs, dedicated corpus subdomain coverage, and tuned clinical applicability scoring.

The goal is to bring **all** procedure families to the same level of output quality:

| Capability | Neurointerventional | Spine / ACDF | Tumor / Functional / Other |
|---|---|---|---|
| Procedure-specific evidence packs | ✅ Full (tiered packs) | 🔄 Planned | 🔄 Planned |
| Corpus subdomain coverage | ✅ 17 dedicated subdomains | 🔄 Needs spine surgery subdomains | 🔄 Needs expansion |
| Clinical applicability quarantine | ✅ Tuned M1/M2/posterior rules | ✅ Added | 🔄 Per-family |
| Dedicated retrieval templates | ✅ Thrombectomy-optimized | ✅ Added (procedure_taxonomy.py) | 🔄 Per-family |
| pgvector (full 1.7M papers) | ✅ Queried via evidence packs | 🔄 Planned | 🔄 Planned |
| Blind review scoring | ✅ 8-9/10 verified | ✅ Template defaults pass, evidence needs pgvector | ❌ Not yet tested |

**Planned work:**

1. **pgvector corpus integration** — Route non-neurointerventional family queries (spine, tumor, functional, Chiari) to the PostgreSQL/pgvector corpus with 1.7M papers instead of relying solely on the lean neurointerventional SQLite database. This will unlock ACDF technique/outcome papers and all other spine surgery literature that doesn't exist in the current local corpus.

2. **Per-family evidence packs** — Extend the evidence-pack pattern (tiered, required-for, conditional) from thrombectomy to all procedure families: ACDF, convexity meningioma, Chiari, functional epilepsy, and future families.

3. **Corpus subdomain expansion** — Add spine surgery, tumor, and functional subdomains to the local corpus, or build procedure-family-specific SQLite databases alongside the pgvector bridge.

4. **Per-family clinical applicability rules** — Each family needs tuned quarantine rules like the ACDF rules added here, keyed off `family.id` in `classify_clinical_applicability()`.

5. **Deterministic eval hardening** — Tighten gates so `needs input` / `needs synthesis` placeholders in evidence sections fail the canonical eval for any family that has completed its evidence pipeline.
