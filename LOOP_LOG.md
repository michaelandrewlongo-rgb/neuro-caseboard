## LOOP COMPLETE (2026-06-16)

WS-1…WS-5 are all green on tests + eval. `caseboard case "<dictation>"` turns a free-text clinical
dictation into a print-grade 8-section case dossier (Clinical Summary · Clinical Reasoning ·
Operative Plan · Alternatives · Risks · Pre-op Optimization · Surgical Technique · Case Figures) with
contemporary PubMed `[L#]` on a separate axis and generated, guard-checked schematics — offline and
deterministic, single evidence axis, topic-agnostic, with `ask`/`build`/`cards` unchanged.
**449 passed, 1 skipped, 0 regressions** across the five passes (baseline was 383).

**Deferred (need a configured provider/visual judge, absent in this environment):** the live
blind text-judge of section quality vs `cases.json` must_cover; live PubMed recency/relevance; the
blind image-opening judge (≥8/10 conceptual + case-specificity) over the rendered schematics. The
offline harnesses (`eval/intake_eval.py`, `eval/case_eval.py`, `eval/figure_spec_eval.py`) render
real artifacts a keyed/visual judge can grade. Per §5 the loop's final subspecialty judge scores
were filled in on a keyed Google Vertex pass — see **LIVE BLIND-JUDGE PASS** below.

## LIVE BLIND-JUDGE PASS (2026-06-16) — the deferred judges, run on Vertex

Ran both deferred live blind judges with the user's **Google Vertex** credentials (Gemini 2.5 Pro,
GCP free credit; **$0 OpenRouter** — that account had no balance, so it was dropped). Both are
MANUAL, credentialed steps kept out of required offline CI. Harnesses: `eval/live_text_judge.py`,
`eval/live_image_judge.py --backend vertex`. Reports: `eval/CASE_TEXT_JUDGE_REPORT_2026-06-16_*.md`,
`eval/CASE_IMAGE_JUDGE_REPORT_2026-06-16_*.md`.

- **Text** (attending-examiner judge vs `cases.json` must_cover/red_flags, 6 cases): mean must-cover
  coverage **65.2% -> 80.7%**, mean overall **6.3 -> 8.2/10**, red-flag bleed **0 -> 0**. Fix: a
  topic-agnostic COMPLETENESS block in `case_author.CASE_SYSTEM` (enumerate every structure-at-risk
  along the corridor + at the target; recognized named post-op deficits; the early postoperative
  emergency + bedside rescue; named rescue maneuvers/adjuncts; closure/reconstruction; team readiness
  + postoperative protocol). A one-off transient model failure on the pediatric case exposed two real
  bugs, both fixed: (1) `build_case_manifest` now RETRIES before degrading to the deterministic
  scaffold; (2) the deterministic fallback no longer reuses caseprep's generic `stop_points` card
  (it hardcodes a cross-subspecialty "abort: VA/carotid..." enumeration the posterior-only guard
  misses) — de-duped against the topic-agnostic cards we author. Pediatric recovered
  31%/overall 1/bleed 1 -> **87.5%/overall 9/bleed 0**.
- **Image** (vision judge opening each rendered PNG; conceptual + case-specificity, target >=8/10,
  6 cases x2): side/level correct **12/12**; mean overall **7.5 -> 7.8/10**, pass **8/12 -> 9/12**.
  Fix 1 (renderer, durable): edge-aware label placement — word-wrap + collision avoidance + white
  halo + leader lines + footer truncation — eliminated the overlap/clipping defects (pediatric
  structures map **2->10**, skull-base corridor **6->9**, convexity-meningioma map **8->10**). Fix 2
  (figure author, topic-agnostic): captions no longer claim a radiographic plane the abstract diagram
  can't deliver; nodes spread >=0.15 by true relative anatomy; depict the pathology; correct spinal
  level ordering; case-matched region; +retry. The approach/**corridor** schematic is reliably 9-10
  across subspecialties. **Known limitation:** the second free-form "structures-at-risk" map stays
  variable under a strict anatomical judge — an inherent ceiling of an abstract node-scatter (and the
  topic-agnostic deterministic floor cannot name real structures). Documented, not over-fit to a
  stochastic judge.

No new runtime dependency; full offline suite **449 passed, 1 skipped, 0 regressions** after the fixes.

## Notes

- **Pass 1 (2026-06-16, WS-1).** Built the structured intake foundation: `CaseContext` dataclass
  (geometry/history/plan + `to_topic()` bridge to the existing pipeline, `missing_critical()` capped
  at 3) and an LLM-first `intake.parse_dictation` (injected `complete_fn`, graceful fallback) with a
  topic-agnostic `deterministic_parse` (age/sex/laterality/level — handedness-aware, disc-range
  preferred over single root level). Offline tests (`test_case_context.py` ×6, `test_intake.py` ×11)
  + a reproducible offline eval (`eval/case_dictations.json`, `eval/intake_eval.py` →
  `eval/CASE_INTAKE_REPORT_2026-06-16.md`). Two bugs the eval caught and fixed in-loop: handedness
  ("right-handed") polluting lesion laterality; single root level ("C6") winning over the disc range
  ("C5-6"). Live model-quality blind grade deferred — no provider key in this environment.
  No new runtime dependency; `caseboard` entry point still imports on core deps.
- **Pass 2 (2026-06-16, WS-2).** Added the eight-surface case taxonomy and an additive case path
  (build untouched): `case_sections.py` (the 8 §0 surfaces with generalizable slot vocab; Operative
  Plan + Risks reuse the build files verbatim), a `compile_case_dossier` built by extracting a
  parameterized `_compile` core from `compile_dossier` (behavior-preserving), a `case_author.py`
  (LLM-first injected author + grounded topic-agnostic deterministic scaffold covering all 8
  sections), and `pipeline.build_case_dossier` (anti-bleed guard → enrich → audit → compile_case).
  Tests: `test_case_sections.py` ×4, `test_case_author.py` ×8, `test_compile.py` +1, `test_pipeline.py`
  +1 (parametrized ×3). Eval `eval/case_eval.py` → `eval/CASE_DOSSIER_REPORT_2026-06-16.md`: 6/6 cases
  render 8/8 sections (deterministic + ground-truth context). Guardrails verified: no hardcoded
  clinical literals in source (grep), build path byte-identical, single evidence axis preserved. Live
  blind text-judge of section quality deferred — no provider key.
- **Pass 3 (2026-06-16, WS-3).** Wired the existing PubMed lane into the case build on a separate
  `[L#]` axis: `Section.literature` (duck-typed, optional — model stays decoupled);
  `case_literature.attach_case_literature` calls `qa.build_literature_section` once per
  reasoning-bearing section (Clinical Reasoning / Alternatives / Risks) with a topic-agnostic
  case-tuned query; `render_md` renders the narrative + `[L#]` rows; `build_case_dossier` gains
  `literature`/`lit_client`/`lit_synth_client`/`lit_cache` args (None → `LITERATURE_RETRIEVAL`).
  Never fabricates — synth cites only the records it is given, citations enumerate those records, and
  tests assert `[L#] ⊆ injected PMIDs`. Offline tests inject a canned cache + synth (no network):
  `test_case_literature.py` ×3, `test_render_md.py` +1, `test_pipeline.py` +1. Eval `case_eval.py`
  extended: 6/6 cases carry `[L#]` on all three sections, no fabrication. Live PubMed recency/relevance
  grade deferred — no `NCBI_API_KEY`. `ask` literature path unchanged.
- **Pass 4 (2026-06-16, WS-4).** The headline: generated **schematic** figures, code-drawn from a
  structured spec (LOOP_PROMPT §2). New `neuro_caseboard/figures_gen/`: `spec.py` (`FigureSpec` +
  tolerant `from_dict`), `author.py` (LLM-first injected author + topic-agnostic deterministic
  fallback; archetype from `classify_profile`, nodes from case geometry), `render.py` (deterministic
  **PIL** renderer — `pillow` is a core dep, so **no new dependency** — byte-stable PNG, mandatory
  "SCHEMATIC — NOT A RADIOGRAPH" banner, per-archetype backdrop), `guard.py` (rejects a spec whose
  side/level/region contradicts the case, reusing `figure_guards`). `generate_case_figures` →
  `FigureItem`s captioned "Schematic (not a radiograph): …"; `build_case_dossier(figures_dir=…)`
  attaches them to the Case Figures section. Tests +20. Eval `eval/figure_spec_eval.py` → 3/3
  archetype + side/level grounding + byte-stability + guard-rejects-flip; artifacts in
  `eval/_fig_specs/`. Blind image-opening judge ≥8/10 deferred — no visual judge in this environment.
- **Pass 5 (2026-06-16, WS-5).** Shipped the case surface. `pipeline.generate_case` (dictation →
  `case-dossier.md` + `.pdf`, schematics rendered into the output dir); `caseboard case "<dictation>"
  [--pdf] [--no-llm] [--no-enrich] [--no-literature] -o dir`; a "Case" Streamlit lane (dictation →
  dossier + schematics + PDF download). Both PDF renderers gained the per-page confidentiality/verify
  banner (`render_pdf` via an `FPDF.footer()` subclass; `caseboard_pdf` via a `position:fixed`
  banner) and the per-section `[L#]` literature block; the offline fpdf2 fallback keeps the CI smoke
  green without Chromium, Unicode font + ASCII fallback preserved. Verified offline: dictation → a
  5-page PDF with all 8 sections, 2 generated schematics, and the verify banner on every page; no new
  runtime dependency; entry point imports on core deps. Tests +8 (`test_caseboard_pdf.py` +2,
  `test_render_pdf.py` +2, `test_cli.py` +1, plus pipeline/figure coverage). 449 passed, 0 regressions.

# OUTPUT-QUALITY LOOP (`caseboard case` — content & figure quality)

Second loop (see the current `LOOP_PROMPT.md`). One job: make the dossier's content and figures
**measurably** better, behind a held-out eval set + an automated quality-regression gate. Baseline
entering this loop: **451 passed, 1 skipped, 0 regressions**.
